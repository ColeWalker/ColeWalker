### Cole Walker - Software Engineer and Programming Streamer :sunglasses:

I'm a software engineer who loves to tinker and play around with things. Many of my repositories are experiments or demos for technologies that I'm interested in. I believe that the web should be accessible to everyone, and I have made it a goal to educate others on building an accessible web.
