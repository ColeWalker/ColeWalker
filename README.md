### Cole Walker - Software Engineer and Programming Streamer :sunglasses:

I'm a software engineer who loves to tinker and play around with things. Many of my repositories are experiments or demos for technologies that I'm interested in. I believe that the web should be accessible to everyone, and I have made it a goal to educate others on building an accessible web. 

### Content
I write content frequently, which can be found on [dev.to.](https://dev.to/colewalker) I tend to write about whatever I'm interested in, or tips about building a more accessible website. 


### Languages
I'm a sucker for TypeScript and JavaScript, but I also have a deep fondness for Go, and I have been known to dabble in other languages. Don't expect my repositories to consist of solely one language, I'm too much of an explorer to stick to one.
